 Hi, everyone. I'm Mike. This time, we use recording mode for the Town Hall. The reason is that our team is getting bigger and bigger. So, this time we use recording mode. I hope everyone can know more about what I want to convey. At the beginning, we talked about the current situation of the company. Last year, our company's performance growth was very good. But since the second half of last year, our performance has encountered some breakthrough points. So in the first half of this year, we have also added many new verticals. We hope to find new breakthrough points and expand the new revenue line. At the same time, this year we have operation process of our professional development this year. We took some time to adapt, but so far it seems to be working quite well. The reason for this change is actually to let all RD partners know more about what our team is developing. There is a full picture. At the same time, other partners in the company will will know the release date and the product will be expected. As of the first half of the year, we have shown some short-term results. The Japanese team also allowed AJ to have a first-stage online. Many major projects such as restaurants and restaurants have also been developed. The change was actually expected to allow the teams to save a lot of time in coordination, resources coordination and conflict. But now it seems that this has not been able to achieve this effect in many larger projects. In the early stage of the project, especially the larger project, it took longer than expected. We are also discussing with the business unit how to make this part shorter. We spent a lot of time discussing this process within RD. Let's talk about how to do this division again. So let's talk about division. We hope that the PM team can align with the business unit very well. Why do we want to do this product? What is the direction of the project is, and then define the specifications of the project, control the time and coordinate resource conflict, and then guide the results of the project. The R&D team can work with PM to take care of technical details, planning, and teamwork. In many cases this time have been the problem of the front-end discussion homework being left out and taking too long. This is a direction that PM and EM need to work hard to solve together. This is the part we need to improve. For the development team, I don't want everyone to focus on doing the project, but to avoid technical issues at the development team, I don't want everyone to focus on doing the brick work, but to avoid technical debt and maintain the stability of development efficiency. So, in the technical team, we will keep a certain proportion of projects that need to be optimized. I also hope that these projects will be listed and discussed, and when they are successful when they have results. This is the technical standard of other teams. Next, we will talk about the initial direction of the product in the second half of the year. In the first half of the year, we have buried a lot of seeds in some new categories. We look forward to seeing these new categories grow. In the second half of the year, we will focus on making our users feel more about the project, and let them have the best experience when they purchase some types of projects. In addition, we will spend a lot of effort on deepening the destination in Japan, so that all users can think of us when they go to Japan. This includes the further integration of our products with AJ, the integration of restaurants, accommodation, and rental cars in Japan, etc. These are the areas we will focus on in the second half of the year. In terms of policy, I think the company still supports the technical team. So we have a lot of resources. But in terms of our overall internal reward, I think I will especially reward those who push forward. A good engineer can be more influential than just a few ordinary engineers. This is something I believe in. As an example, last year's end of the year, there were some top-notch partners who showed special performance. Their end of the year could reach three to five months. We reward people who play a cross-group influence, and at the same time, others find out and see. The best way is to start from yourself, and pay close attention to other team members who cooperate with the project together, and give some of your own suggestions. Roll up your sleeves and push forward the project together. Here I want to thank Jeremy and Kim for their efforts in these big cases. Finally, like our 10th anniversary slogan, KKDAY, Make My Day, our work can be close to people's lives, and solve the inconvenience in people's travel, and bring happiness. This is a very fortunate thing for us. At the same time, the commercial environment is also very competitive. A few years ago, it may have been a big company, but maybe it has now from the people's view. So we must strengthen our competitiveness. And while our company is moving towards the world stage, we must become a world-class technical team. We must not be satisfied with the current situation. We must not only discover the problem, but also raise our sleeves and solve it together. We must challenge the more difficult problems and exert greater influence. Finally, I would like to emphasize again that I do not favor the elimination of the last position, but this does not mean that the last position will not be eliminated. The most important thing is that more resources and light rings will be given to the people in front of you and the partners who will lead everyone to the sprint together. Use the influence of the team to push things forward quickly. Thank you everyone.
